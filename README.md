The original website looks like this

And I found that it doesn't match the website it's supposed to. they should not publish something that there is no content in it. just like this

they supposed to put it on draft, and publish it when they already had their content with.
i try my best to re-design everything, but i'm so bad with that stuff, so i'm looking for a way to make it easier, and i found an AI to make a website, and i modify most of them, so it came out like this

i took the content from their instagram account, and i think they can use the content on their instagram to uploud it on their website.
